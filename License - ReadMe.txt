License Terms:

You MUST say that the Parkour Gamemode is made by Yoshey in your workshop file's description and you MUST include the "Credits" blueprint visibly at the start of your map. You may not modify the Credits or anything marked to not modify.

You MUST NOT remove or change any of the watermarks AND they MUST be fully visible.

NOTE: My Donators will receive Donator rewards automatically on your map. However, to compensate you for making a map for my Gamemode, you receive all Donator rewards for free on your own map. For this you just need to add your Name and SteamID64 to the Parkour_Gamelogic Blueprint.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in your map being taken down from the Pavlov Workshop.
