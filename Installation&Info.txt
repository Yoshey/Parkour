------------------------Extra------------------------
The Parkour Gamemode works best for Dedicated Servers. Some parts will break or fail with Default Servers such as Leaderboards, but Map Developement can be done with them.

Feel free to Message me on Discord (Yoshey#0001) and I might include your Map on my Dedicated Servers.


To get the Parkour Gamemode working, you have to drop the "Parkour_Gamelogic" into your Map. (Add your SteamID64 and Name to it's Variables to receive all my Donator Rewards)

Next, open the "TimeTrial" Folder. Drag and Drop the "ScoreboardPersonalBest" and "ScoreboardTop15" into your Map. Next, Select the ScoreboardPersonalBest, link the Personal Scoreboard in it's Variables and input a Filename.

Afterwards, Drop the "Timer" "StartTime" and "StopTime" into your Map. Select them and link the Variable to the ScoreboardTop15. This will automatically make them Register to that TimeTrial.

Last, Open the "Teleport" Folder and Drag and Drop the Teleport and Destination into your Map. It's recommended to always place one at the end of your Track. Just select teh Teleport and hook up the Destination and it will work. You can use this for Checkpoints as well!
